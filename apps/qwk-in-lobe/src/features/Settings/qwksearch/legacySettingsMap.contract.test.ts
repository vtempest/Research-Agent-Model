/**
 * The drift guard for § 2.1's map.
 *
 * `legacySettingsMap.ts` describes two codebases it cannot import: the legacy
 * settings surface, which lives in the root Bun workspace and is bundled for
 * Next.js, and the engine's own tab registry, which is a module full of
 * `dynamic()` imports that would pull half the SPA into this test. So both
 * halves are read from disk as text instead, and every claim the map makes
 * about a file, a section key or a tab is checked against the thing itself.
 *
 * What that buys: the map cannot quietly stop being true. If a tenth section
 * is added to `sections.json`, if a field is added to `search.json`, if
 * upstream renames or drops a settings pane, or if one of the legacy
 * components moves, this fails — instead of 2.4 reading a stale page and
 * deleting a section that had nowhere to land.
 *
 * It deliberately does not check *judgement*: whether a gap is really a gap is
 * not testable, and re-deciding it is the next run's job.
