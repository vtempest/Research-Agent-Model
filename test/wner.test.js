  "Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].",
  "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences.",
  "Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h , as a function of the previous hidden state h and the input for position t .",
  "This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.",
  "Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21 ] and conditional computation [ 32 ], while also improving model performance in case of the latter.",
  "The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.",
