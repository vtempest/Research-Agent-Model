/**
 * § 2.1 of the LobeHub Migration To-Do — the old settings surface mapped onto
 * this engine — written as data instead of prose.
 *
 * Phase 2.4 deletes `apps/qwksearch-web/components/Settings/**`, its
 * `app/settings/[[...section]]` route and `app/api/config`. It may only do that
 * once every section of the old surface has somewhere to land, and the thing
 * that decides "somewhere to land" is this file: each entry names the legacy
 * section, what actually stores its values today, the engine tab that takes it
 * over, and — the part that matters — what is still missing before the legacy
 * section can be deleted.
 *
 * Why data and not a doc section. The map is only useful if it is still true
 * when 2.4 runs, and a prose map decays silently: upstream renames a tab, we
 * add a pane, someone adds a tenth section to `sections.json`, and the page
 * still reads as if it were current. `legacySettingsMap.contract.test.ts`
 * checks this file against both halves it describes — `sections.json` and
 * `search.json` on the QwkSearch side, `componentMap.ts` and the feature
 * directories on the engine side — so drift fails a test instead of misleading
 * a later run. It is the same mechanism the two panes' `contract.test.ts` use
 * for their routes, one level up.
 *
 * Nothing imports this at runtime. It is a migration artifact with a guard,
 * and it is deleted along with the surface it describes.

 * - **`localStorage`** — per-browser, no server copy, so there is nothing to
 *   migrate *from* on another device. That is 2.3's "announce a one-time
 *   re-entry; do not build a migrator", and it includes credentials.
 * - **Worker A tables** (`/api/user/*`, `/api/agent/*`) — real per-user rows in
