/**
 * D1 read replication via the Sessions API.
 *
 * With read replication enabled, D1 answers reads from a replica in the region
 * nearest the request instead of from the single primary instance in WNAM —
 * the win is round trips, not query time. A replica can lag the primary,
 * though, so reads have to be pinned to a database version or a user can write
 * a row and then not see it. That is what a *session* is for: every query in a
 * session carries a bookmark, and D1 only lets the session read a version at
 * least as new as everything it has already seen (sequential consistency), no
 * matter which replica answers.
 *
 * The lifecycle of one request:
 *
 *   1. The Worker entry opens a session scope (`runWithD1Session`), seeded
 *      with the bookmark the client returned from its previous request.
 *   2. `sessionedD1()` wraps the raw `DB` binding so every statement
 *      drizzle prepares runs inside that request's single session.
 *   3. The Worker entry writes the session's closing bookmark back onto the
 *      response (`applyD1Bookmark`), so the next request picks up where this
 *      one left off.
 *
 * Requests that never touch D1 never open a session, and outside a session
 * scope (prerendering, scripts, unit tests) the wrapper is a pass-through to
 * the plain binding. Authentication opts out of replica reads entirely — see
 * `PRIMARY_ONLY_PATH_PREFIXES`. The Sessions API is also a no-op on databases with read
 * replication turned off, so this is safe to deploy before — and independently
 * of — flipping the switch in the D1 dashboard.
 *

 *
 * Authentication is the case that matters. Its short-lived rows (`verification`
 * above all — OAuth state, magic-link tokens, e-mail verification tokens) are
 * written by one request and read back by a *different* one seconds later, and
 * the reader routinely arrives with no bookmark to resume from:
 *
 *   - the OAuth callback is a cross-site redirect back from the provider, and
 *     if anything about the flow crosses hosts (an apex/`beta.`/preview split,
 *     a sign-in started in one origin and finished in another) the host-scoped
 *     `d1_bookmark` cookie simply is not sent;
 *   - a magic link is clicked out of a mail client, often in a different
 *     browser or on a different device, which has never held a bookmark at all;
 *   - a bookmark that *is* present can be an older one, having been overwritten
 *     by a concurrent request that started before the write landed.
 *
 * In every one of those cases `resolveStart` would otherwise pick
 * `first-unconstrained` (or an out-of-date bookmark) and the read can be
 * answered by a replica that has not caught up yet. The row is missing, and
 * better-auth turns that into `State mismatch: verification not found` — a
 * failed sign-in with `?error=state_mismatch`, intermittent by nature because
 * it depends on replication lag at that instant.
 *
 * So these paths always start on the primary: correctness beats the round trip
 * saved, and they are a small fraction of traffic (page renders read the
 * session through the ordinary bookmarked path and are unaffected).
